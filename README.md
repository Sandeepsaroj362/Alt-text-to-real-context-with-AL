Alt-Text-to-Real-Context with AI
Project Overview
Alt-Text-to-Real-Context with AI is an innovative project designed to enhance accessibility and understanding of digital content by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to generate meaningful and contextually accurate descriptions of images. This project aims to convert alt-text (alternative text) into rich, real-world context, making digital content more accessible to visually impaired users and improving the overall user experience.

Key Features
AI-Powered Alt-Text Generation: Utilizes state-of-the-art AI models to generate descriptive and contextually accurate alt-text for images.

Contextual Enrichment: Enhances basic alt-text with additional context, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the image content.

Accessibility Focus: Designed to improve accessibility for visually impaired users by providing detailed and meaningful descriptions of visual content.

Easy Integration: Simple integration with existing platforms and repositories, making it easy to adopt and use.

How It Works
Image Input: Users upload an image to the system.

Alt-Text Generation: The AI model analyzes the image and generates initial alt-text.

Contextual Enrichment: The system enriches the alt-text with additional context, providing a more detailed description.

Output: The final, contextually enriched alt-text is provided to the user, ready for use in digital content.
